# AnimalSounds
## iBooks Project
This project is part of a series of projects in the Adaptive User Interfaces portion of "Intro to App Development with Swift" iBook series. The purpose is to create an interactive user interface including sound and text.
The user is presented with three emoji icons (cat, dog, cow) with an area for text above (Animal Sounds) and below (Tap an Animal). When the user clicks on an animal choice, that animal's sound plays and the word version of that sound is displayed above.

### Known Issues
Prior to upload there was an Xcode update and this project incurred new errors to the dependencies. I am currently working to resolve those and will upload corrections to the project when that work is concluded.
